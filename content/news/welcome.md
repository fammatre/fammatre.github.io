Hello everyone! Welcome to Fammatre Elementary's Garden Website!

We'll be using this space to post significant updates regarding the garden.

In addition, I'll also update this website with information on planting
schedules (for our lovely zone 9b) and various grant resources that may be
available to us and other local schools.
