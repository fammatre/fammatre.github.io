**Woo! The garden is officially up and running!**

Yesterday, the 4th graders came in and planted some Purple Dragon Carrots. The
pictures you see here is the result of their effort.

If everything goes well, we should start seeing sprouts in 12-18 days. Harvest
time for these beauties should be in early December (possibly as early as
November 30th).

## Completed Projects

As far as other projects go, the drip irrigation lines are all up and running
now for garden beds 1-5. The old 1/2" drip emitter line with 18" spacing that 
was in the beds when we started was quite leaky and weathered. So, that was all
removed up to the PVC line and replaced with fresh 1/2" distribution line 
hidden under the soil. Then, 1/4" drip emitter line with 6" spacing is attached
to that (the four small drip lines visible in each bed).

The old garden timers were replaced with new timers. San Jose's water source is
typically groundwater, which means significant CaCO3 (calcium carbonate)
buildup. Although an attempt was made to clean them with CLR, the decision was
made to put them in retirement.

In addition, the old timers were attached to misaligned PVC (both input and
output were connected to rigid PVC). This resulted in significant leakage. So,
to fix this, the PVC was cut and rerouted to allow for a garden hose to attach
to the timer output. This new configuration has resulted in a leak-free setup.

## Current Projects

Currently in progress is an update to the irrigation surrounding the garden
shed. Shallow trenching is in progress to provide irrigation to the flower bed
area, as well as two citrus trees and raised bed 7. If you're in the area, you
may see this work in progress today.

## Future Projects

After irrigation near the garden shed area is complete, the next project will
be to replace the leaky PVC between raised beds 1 and 2 which irrigates raised
bed 6 (the raised bed in the center of raised beds 1-5). Note that irrigation
for raised beds 1 and 2 is provided by the source between raised beds 4 and 5,
so this project does not affect the operation of raised beds 1 and 2.

New pressure regulators have been ordered to account for the high water
pressure available at the garden. The water pressure at the garden
[is a bit over 80psi](/images/2022-09-21-pressure-gauge.jpg). However, the regulators
currently installed are rated up to 70 psi. We've already broken several of the
common regulators found at our local big box store. As soon as the new
regulators arrive, we'll install them right away.

In addition, the numbers marking each raised bed are in need of repair. We're
on the lookout for a way to replace them. If you have any ideas, please let us
know.
