Thank you for your interest in joining us!

Typically, only current parent and guardians of students at Fammatre are
permitted to participate in garden activities (as well as Fammatre faculty and
staff).

We communicate mostly through two channels. If you'd like to join us, please
sign up for one (or both!) of these communication platforms:

* **[Click here to join our Slack chat.](https://garden.fammatre.org/chat)**
* **[Click here to join our Facebook group.](https://facebook.com/groups/fammatre)**

If you have trouble signing up for either of these, please [contact us using email](mailto:garden-join-issues@fammatre.org).
